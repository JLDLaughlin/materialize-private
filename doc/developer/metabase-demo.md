# Metabase demo instructions

The purpose of this demo is to visualize Materialize queries and
highlight the ease of connecting to BI (business intelligence) tools.


The Metabase demo can be run:
1. Manually on your laptop
1. Using Docker
1. On AWS

For now, these instructions only describe how to run the Metabase demo
with Docker, although many steps are the same between the three.

## Docker

### Starting the Docker containers and loading data

First, we use [this script](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/master/ex/chbench/dc.sh)
to pull the necessary Docker images, bring containers up with Docker compose, and 
load an initial set of data. To do that, we run:

```console
$ ./dc.sh up :init:
$ ./dc.sh up :demo:
```

Note: Running :init: loads an initial set of TPC-CH data into Materialize.
Running :demo: will  load that same data in Materialize again. In the future,
we should find a way to load data/initialize tables without creating these duplicates.

Now that the data is loaded into Materialize, we want to create sources
with it. Enter a psql shell connected to Materialize:

```console
psql -h localhost -p 6875 gssencmode=disable\ sslmode=disable
```

And create the sources:

```console
CREATE SOURCES LIKE 'mysql.tpcch.%' FROM 'kafka://kafka:9092' USING SCHEMA REGISTRY 'http://schema-registry:8081';
```

### Connecting Metabase to Materialize

Starting up the required Docker containers using `dc.sh` brings up the Metabase 
and Materialize services. Now, we need to connect the two.

To open Metabase, go to `localhost:3030` in your browser. 
You should see Metabase is already running, but needs you to 
create a user and connect to a database. Note: Each time you 
restart the Metabase container, you will need to create a 
user and reconnect to Materialize.

To create a user, simply fill in the user information fields.
This information is not important, although you may be asked to log in 
at another point in the future.

To connect to Materialize, provide Metabase with the following 
host and port information:
- Host: materialized (the name of the Materialize Docker service)
- Port: 6875

All of the other fields Metabase requests to connect to the database
(such as username and password), are arbitrary for the time being.

Next, you will either agree/disagree to send analytics back to Metabase.
You will be able to continue through either way.

You should now be able to see the main Metabase dashboard.


### Configuring Metabase

Once you have connected Metabase to Materialize and you are able to 
see the main dashboard, you will want to sync the Metabase and
Materialize database schemas. To do that, you should:
1. Navigate to `admin/databases` in your browser
2. Click on the database you created 
3. Click "sync database schema now" in the top right
4. Go back to the `/` path

Now that Metabase is connected to Materialize, we can create a demo dashboard.
To do this, you will have to:
- Create a new dashboard
- Create questions (queries) in Metabase
- Add questions to the dashboard


#### Create a new dashboard
From the `/` path, you should be able to create a dashboard by clicking the
`+` button in the top right hand corner. 


#### Create questions
From the `/` path, you should be able to create a question by clicking the
"Ask a Question" button in the top right hand corner, taking you to
`/question/new`. 

To demo Materialize, we have been adding two copies of a handful of 
queries to a demo dashboard: one copy without a view and one copy
with a view. Note: You have to manually create these views in order
for the second query to work, either through your `psql` shell or
the Metabase interactive SQL editor.

- A Simple count:
    - Basic query:
      ```sql
      SELECT count(*) AS "count"
      FROM "mysql_tpcch_orderline";
      ```
    - Create the view:
      ```sql
      CREATE VIEW orderline_count AS 
      SELECT count(*) FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline;
      ```
    - Use the view:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM orderline_count;
      ```

- Q01:
    - Basic query:
      ```sql
        SELECT
            ol_number,
            sum(ol_quantity) AS sum_qty,
            sum(ol_amount) AS sum_amount,
            avg(ol_quantity) AS avg_qty,
            avg(ol_amount) AS avg_amount,
            count(*) AS count_order
        FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline
        WHERE ol_delivery_d > TIMESTAMP '2007-01-02 00:00:00.000000'
        GROUP BY ol_number
        ORDER BY ol_number;
      ```
    - Create the view:
      ```sql
        CREATE VIEW q01 AS
        SELECT
            ol_number,
            sum(ol_quantity) AS sum_qty,
            sum(ol_amount) AS sum_amount,
            avg(ol_quantity) AS avg_qty,
            avg(ol_amount) AS avg_amount,
            count(*) AS count_order
        FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline
        WHERE ol_delivery_d > TIMESTAMP '2007-01-02 00:00:00.000000'
        GROUP BY ol_number
        ORDER BY ol_number; 
      ```
    - Use the view:
      ```sql
        SELECT * FROM q01;
      ```

More queries can be found and added from the appendix.
      

#### Add questions to the dashboard
